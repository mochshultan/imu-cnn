## 1. Environment Setup and Dependencies# Robust Fall Detection Training with CNN-LSTM
## Two-Step Verification System for Elderly Fall Detection

This notebook implements a robust training pipeline for fall detection using:
- CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture for temporal video analysis
- TFRecord dataset from Roboflow
- Model optimization for ESP32C3 deployment
- INT8 quantization for edge devices

### Hardware Target: XiaoESP32C3 + Grove Vision AI V2
